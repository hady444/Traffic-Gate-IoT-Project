## Introduction

The IoT Smart Gate System is designed to improve the security and operational efficiency of automated gate systems. By integrating real-time data processing and remote management, the system provides a reliable solution for vehicle detection and gate control.


## Project Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from the need for enhanced security and efficiency in automated gate control systems. Observing the inefficiencies and security gaps in existing systems, we aimed to develop a solution that integrates real-time data processing, remote management, and reliable vehicle detection.

## Technology & Architecture

### Technology

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- **Firebase RTDB**
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**
- **Keypad Interface**
- **Servo Motors**
- **WiFi Connectivity**

### Architecture

1. ESP32 connects to WiFi and syncs time.
2. Sensors detect vehicle presence and user input.
3. Firebase RTDB logs data and manages states.
4. Servos control gate movements.

## Core Algorithms

The core algorithm involves vehicle detection and gate control. When an ultrasonic sensor detects a vehicle, it triggers the servo motor to open the gate and logs this event in Firebase RTDB. If no vehicle is detected, the gate remains closed.
